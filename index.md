Hi, I am Inmo Jang, an Assistant Professor at Korea Aerospace University. My research interests range over the areas of multi-robot/agent systems, decentralised autonomous decision-making, control and navigation for robots, human multi-robot interaction, and their real-world applications. 

Prior to joining the university, I was a Principal Robotics Research Engineer and Head of EHS Automation Part at Samsung Electronics, where I worked with the mission of "Creating a Robot/AI System for inspecting semiconductor fabrication plants". Before that, I was a postdoctoral research associate in Robotics for Extreme Environment Group at the University of Manchester, where I was involved in RAIN(Robotics and AI in Nuclear) project, one of the four big robotics and AI projects funded by EPSRC. I was also a JAEA NEST Fellow (visiting researcher) at the University of Tokyo, Japan in 2020. Since 2015, I have worked towards decision making of multi-robot systems and finished PhD in Cranfield University, UK, under Prof Hyo-Sang Shin and Prof Antonios Tsourdos. In South Korea, I had worked at Korea Aerospace Industries, Ltd., and also worked at Korea Institute of Aviation Safety Technology  in total 5+ years. Before that, I completed MSc/BSc in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering in Seoul National University, S.Korea.

As I am very keen on collaborating on any kind research topics of multi-agent/robot systems, feel free to contact me. Also, check out my GitHub and YouTube channel where you can see glimpses of my ongoing work!
